## Long Description

Messy component pages slow everyone down. Heavy Page Organizer cleans them up in one click.

**How it works:**
Run the plugin, set your horizontal and vertical spacing, and hit Apply. Every component on the current page is sorted alphabetically into columns. Sub-components (names starting with `.`) are automatically grouped below their parent. Sections are placed to the right of all component columns.

**Smart sub-component matching:**
`.ButtonGroup/Item` goes under `ButtonGroup`, not `Button`. The plugin matches each sub-component to its longest matching parent name using `/`, `.`, and space delimiters — so similarly-named parents never steal each other's children.

**Orphan handling:**
Sub-components with no matching parent aren't left behind. They get their own column before the sections, and the notification tells you how many were orphaned so you can rename or reorganize them.

**Column-aware layout:**
Each column is as wide as its widest element — if a sub-component is wider than its parent, the next column accounts for that. No overlapping, no manual nudging.

**Remembers your settings:**
Spacing values are saved per machine. Reopen the plugin and your last-used values are already filled in.

**Who it's for:** Designers who maintain component libraries and want a quick way to tidy up pages without dragging frames around by hand.
